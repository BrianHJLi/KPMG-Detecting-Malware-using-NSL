# KPMG-Detecting-Malware-using-NSL

`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` is used to split the training, validation, and test data; the output files are `train_data.csv`, `valid_data.csv`, and `test_data.csv` in `\dataset` folder.

`Capstone.ipynb` file includes 4 models we used in the experiments, including logistic regression (LR) model, nerual network (NN) model, long-short term memory (LSTM) model, and the nerual structured learning (NSL) model. We ran our experiments on Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To reporduce results shown in the progress report, please run `Capstone.ipynb` in Colab with given settings.
